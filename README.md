# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game frontend repository! This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a simple Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against the computer. The computer generates a random choice, and the game keeps track of wins and losses for both you and the computer.

# Introduction
The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are rock, paper, and scissors, and the winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

This frontend implementation of the game allows you to play against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options.

# Features
Simple Interface: The game features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to understand and play.
Computer Opponent: You can play against the computer, which randomly generates its choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
Win/Loss Tracking: The game keeps track of wins and losses for both you and the computer, providing feedback on your performance.
